 :penguin: Linux configuration files

 Repository contains many config files from ~/.config and /usr/share
 
### dependencies
 Most of the dependencies for i3 are in config/i3 directory, but:
 - i3icons2 which allows you to dynamically change the name of the workspace based on contents. For i3icons2 you need to install package from AUR or compile it from source - [i3icons2](https://github.com/nwhirschfeld/i3icons2). Also you need fontawesome-icons v5 to display icons instead of the program names.
